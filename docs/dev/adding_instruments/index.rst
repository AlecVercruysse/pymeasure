Adding instruments
##################

You can make a significant contribution to PyMeasure by adding a new instrument to the :code:`pymeasure.instruments` package. Even adding an instrument with a few features can help get the ball rolling, since its likely that others are interested in the same instrument.

Before getting started, become familiar with the :doc:`contributing work-flow <../contribute>` for PyMeasure, which steps through the process of adding a new feature (like an instrument) to the development version of the source code. This section will describe how to lay out your instrument code.
